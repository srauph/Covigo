You may not need to make a .env; it's only if django can't find your npm installation that this would be necessary.

To make one, create a file, call it `.env` (no name, just .env), open it, and in it put ONLY this line:

```
NPM_BIN_PATH="path/to/npm"
```

Replace `path/to/npm` with the full path to your npm installation.
